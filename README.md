# Switchfully Code of conduct

Switchfully aims to create an environment where everyone can be themselves. A place where you feel at home and respected. While we do not believe in creating and enforcing a strict set of rules, we do feel that it is always good to highlight certain aspects which we deem important in such an environment.

Therefore, we all agree to the following:

## Respect is key:
* We are a team but at some point you will encounter individual differences between each other. This is very normal and by no means something to feel good or bad about. Are you very self-confident about a certain aspect of the course? Great! Now spread that knowledge and help colleagues who might need a little more time to reach the same point as you. Feel like you could use some help? Don’t feel shy to ask your colleagues for help. Explaining something to a colleague is an important skill for anyone. You’ll both be helping each other grow!
* When interacting, it is important to make sure to respect each other’s feelings. Especially in a remote context, words can sometimes have a different impact than intended. 
		
## Awesome working/learning experience:
* Everyone will do our very best to provide the best working/learning experience possible. In this journey, both Switchfully and yourself have responsibilities. Everyone will do all they can to help you when needed. If, at any point, you feel like you’re losing the battle, just let anyone know. Everyone will happily bolster your defenses, but we can only do so when you ask us. Don’t feel shy, we’re all in this together!
		
## Open atmosphere:
* We have a very open atmosphere at Switchfully. We never judge and experience tells us there’s always a solution to (almost) any problem. If you are in need of a talk, feel free to poke whoever you feel comfortable with for a chat. This can be someone of the Switchfully team, a colleague or someone from Cegeka.  
		
## Feedback is a gift:
* If you have feedback towards somebody, feel free to share this at any moment. It helps them improve and in turn results in a better working/learning experience for you, your colleagues and all future colleagues. You'll notice the importance of feedback during your days at Switchfully.
